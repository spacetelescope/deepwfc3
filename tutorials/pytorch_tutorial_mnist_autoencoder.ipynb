    "## Introduction <a id=\"intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this notebook is to build an autoencoder in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), a deep learning Python library. This tutorial is not an exhaustive introduction to machine learning and assumes the user is familiar with vocabulary (supervised v unsupervised, neural networks, loss functions, backpropogation, etc) and methodology (model selection, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, etc). This notebook also assumes the user is familiar with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the [MNIST handwritten dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Look at [Additional Resources](#add) for more complete machine learning guides. The paragraphs below serve as a brief introduction to autoencoders.\n",
    "\n",
    "An [autoencoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder) is an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns how to reconstruct the input as an output (i.e. using a neural network to learn a complex version of the identify function). It is comprised of an encoder, which compresses the input into a low dimensional latent space, and a decoder, which decompresses the representation from the latent space into the output. Autoencoders are versatile models with some of the main uses including dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and image denoising. Below explains why each purpose may be useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dimensionality reduction: If an autoencoder is able to reconstruct the input to a high degree, then the latent space (low dimensionality) must be a well constructed representation of the input space (high dimensionality). That is to say the model has learned an efficient, compressed representation of the data. You could vastly decrease the training time or increase the complexity of other machine learning models by using the latent space representation as features instead of using the original inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Example: on a training data of cats and dogs, the autoencoder could differentiate between these two classes in the latent space (a cluster of cat images separate from a cluster of dog images). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Anomaly detection: If an autoencoder is able to reconstruct the input to a high degree, then it has learned the features and distribution of the training data well. Therefore features outside of the distribution of the training data will reconstruct poorly and can be automatically detected by having a high loss compared to inputs within the distribution. **Note: a deep model trained on an extremely diverse dataset could learn features general enough to reconstruct inputs outside of its learned domain. Since the model is \"too good\", the model may perform poorly on anomaly detection.** \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Example: on training data of cats and dogs, the autoencoder has learned the features of these two animals. If an image of a car was an input, the autoencoder would not understand this image and would try to reconstruct a cat or dog, leading to a high loss between the input and reconstruction.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Image denoising: An autoencoder in theory can be mapped between any two input and output spaces. If we use training data with features as noisy input and labels as clean inputs, then the autoencoder will learn to remove the noise from those inputs. Now any noisy inputs from the future can be denoised and used for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Example: on training data of noisy cat images as features and clean cat images as labels, the autoencoder could denoise any new cat images.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Other types of autoencoders exists, such as the [variational autoencoder (VAE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_autoencoder), but implementing one is beyond the scope of this tutorial.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**In this notebook, we will build an autoencoder using PyTorch to learn the representation of MNIST handwritten digit dataset. We will also go over the first two use cases of an autoencoder as a dimensionality reducer and an anomaly detector.**"

However, as the number of dimensions increases so does the amount of information the latent space can store. The classes could further be distinguished in these slightly higher dimensions (5-10), but still far lower than the original input space (784).\n",

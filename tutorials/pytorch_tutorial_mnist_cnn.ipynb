    "## Introduction <a id=\"intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this notebook is to teach basic functionality of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), a deep learning Python library. This tutorial is not an exhaustive introduction to machine learning and assumes the user is familiar with vocabulary (supervised v unsupervised, neural networks, loss functions, backpropogation, etc) and methodology (model selection, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, etc). Look at [Additional Resources](#add) for more complete machine learning guides. The paragraphs below serve as a brief refresher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is a set of data driven algorithms in which a model can be trained to make predictions based off of past experiences. There are two main regimes of ML: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning techniques, such as regression and classification, require labels in order to be trained. Unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, do not require labels to be trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are a subset of models that learn to extract features useful for training. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are neural networks that are excellent in computer vision, i.e. solving problems involving images. A CNN convolves patches of an image to learn filters that are useful for training. These networks became more accessible by [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet) in 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "[MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is a dataset of 70,000 (60,000 train; 10,000 test) of handwritten digits from 0-9 (inclusive). Each image is 28 pixels by 28 pixels, each pixel being an 8-bit integer (0-255 integer gray scaled). The dataset is small compared to real world datasets used in industry, but is clean and large enough to use for efficient modeling. In addition, because of how well defined the features and labels are, it has become a staple in learning and testing different algorithms dealing with images.\n",

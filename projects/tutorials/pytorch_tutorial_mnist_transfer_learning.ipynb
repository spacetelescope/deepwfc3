    "## Introduction <a id=\"intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate transfer learning in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), a deep learning Python library. This tutorial is not an exhaustive introduction to machine learning and assumes the user is familiar with vocabulary (supervised v unsupervised, neural networks, loss functions, backpropogation, etc) and methodology (model selection, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, etc). This notebook also assumes the user is familiar with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the [MNIST handwritten dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Look at [Additional Resources](#add) for more complete machine learning guides. The paragraphs below serve as a brief introduction to transfer learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning) is a method of machine learning that uses a well trained model to solve a similar problem instead of the problem it was orginally designed for. Training and tuning a deep model takes a lot of time, data, and computation, so it's not in the best interest for all models to be trained from scratch when some really high performing models already exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a pretrained model as a \"feature extractor\" by freezing most of the layers in the model. Then, we can retrain the unforzen layers after changing the number of output neurons specific to our problem (e.g. changing the number of final classifications from 1000 to 10) and/or adding more hidden layers to the end of the pretrained model (e.g. changing the number of hidden fully connected layers from 1 to 3). At the end, we'll have a model that was initially designed for one task customized for our task. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's take a CNN trained to classify house cats and house dogs. The model will learn features that are useful for distinguishing between the two animals, such as ears, noses, etc. That model can transfer it's knowledge to classify lynxes and wolves, animals that are similar to cats and dogs. The model can use it previous knowledge of ears, noses, etc. to fine tune on and immediately produce good results. In addition, you don't have to go through the trouble of training an entire model from scratch, which would dramatically increase training time and computation for a possible drop in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To extrapolate from that example, extremely deep CNNs trained on an extensive diverse dataset will learn features general enough for a large number of computer vision problems, such as multiclass classification and object detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main uses for transfer learning are when you have data limits or computation limits, which are explained below:\n",
    "- Data Limitations: most datasets to solve real world problems are actually pretty small, making them proned to overfitting if being trained on too deep of a network. The most adventageous solution is to obtain more trainning data, but that could be heavily taxing and time consuming. However, utilizing a model previously trained on millions of examples could be a nice starting point since it already has well defined features useful for solving most problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Computation Limitations: training a deep network from scratch can take anywhere between hours to weeks depending on the scope of the problem at hand. Not everyone has the time or the resources to train deep models. However, since a pretrained model acts as a feature extractor, backpropagation is only performed on the last few layers, which is computationally inexpensive and faster than training from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook, we will perform transfer learning on a pretrained network to classify MNIST handwritten digits using PyTorch.**"

    "Transfer learning can be a powerful tool in the absence of data, time, and/or computational resources. In most cases, it's often better to train an entire model from scratch if those restrictions previously mentioned do not apply. However in the real world, those restrictions are frequent and challenging to deal with as a data scientist. It's nice to have a technique that can compensate for small training data and \"slow\" computers, which in the end makes machine learning and deep learning more accessible to all.\n",
